1. Make a copy of the Jupyter notebook where you generated a model to predict if a customer will pay a loan or not. Add the corresponding code to obtain and display the confusion matrix of the model in the train and test sets.
2. Can the Bank afford a mistake where the real loan status is 'B' and the model predicts status 'A'?
